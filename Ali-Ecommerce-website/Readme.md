# E-Commerce Website

## Introduction

- My project is about E-Commerce Website .E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling products on online services or over the Internet.The existence value of e-commerce is to allow consumers to shop online and pay online through the Internet, saving the time and space of customers and enterprises, greatly improving transaction efficiency, especially for busy office workers, and also saving a lot of valuable time.If I precisely describe my website, then I can say that all things you can buy under one roof with diverse quality on amzing prices .By layoutwise , my website consists of different portions.The first portion is header and header contains one logo, one location, api one search bar and then one language tab and then log in and sign up forms.After the header, there is a navigation bar, navigation bar consists of 9 options and 7 out of 9 options has a drop down menu and then next is  main section which  we have 5 to 6 Container and each ahs 3 cards about different products description.Lastly, I have footer for further contacts.



## Header

- It has many elements(which I describe in introduction ). As all the elements has Centeral position vertically and horizontally . It has also space between them with specifc padding and Cursor pointer.For location, I use the Javascript API.

## NavBar

- The next thing is Navbar.

- Navigation has submenus that are revealed on hover.
- These options has further options and you can easily reach to that options and can view that pages in the drop down.
- in drop down menu , For example, in about section we have a story Vision and customer review.
- So after clicking, you can easily access to these pages.
- Similarly, other options also have drop down menus and all options in drop downs and in nav bar all are well connected with each other.
- As added a proper address to the `href.we can easily access these options by clicking on them like they are properly connected with each other.

## Slider

- In slider(clouser), I Created the slideshow using the carousel component(took it from Bootstrap official website ).
- clip-path animation is used to reveal the content on hover over info icon.
- Animation is applied to the text for moving left-right.

## Container

- I have 5 to 6 Containers which contain the cards and elements in containers are horizontally and vertically center.

## Cards

- I Created the cards section which mostly contain an image ,heading and descrition with appropriate links .
- I also used Other classes from Bootstrap as well, such as
- Sizing utilities
- Spacing utilities

- Main page and all other pages have images which are properly accessed using src attribute .

## Videos

- Small advertising videos used in special offer.html page with video and source tags.

- Form has Appropriate number of date field
- Input fields have labels
- Form page has a background image.
- The form is centered on the page
- All input fields be aligned vertically

## Footer Links

-In the "Footer Links" section, I have added an unordered list beneath the `h3` element. The unordered list should have a class of `icon-list`. Inside the unordered list, added three list items. Each list item should have a class of `icon`. Every list item should have an anchor link nested inside. Also added an proper address to the `href.
